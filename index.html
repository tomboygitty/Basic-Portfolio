                        My name is Tom Elliott and I'm from Nashville, TN. 
                        I have lived here my whole life. I like music, 
                        movies, video games and anime. I like to jog and 
                        lift weights and occasionally play guitar.
                    
                    </p>
                    <p class="otherfont">  
                        I would like to visit, and possibly even live in 
                        Japan some day. I can speak very basic Japanese.
                        I am a fount of random pop culture knowledge and 
                        like to play bar trivia. One of my favorite 
                        activities is private karaoke with friends!

                        Currently, I am studying full-stack development 
                        through a boot camp at Vanderbilt University. I 
                        have always enjoyed computers, technology and 
                        programming, so I hope to use these skills to 
                        develop a fulfilling career.
